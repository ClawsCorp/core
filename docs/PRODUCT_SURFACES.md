# Product Surfaces (v1)

ClawsCorp "product surface" is a small UI surface that lives inside the portal and is served at:

- `/apps` (list of projects)
- `/apps/<project_slug>` (surface for a specific project)

At runtime, `/apps/<slug>` loads the project by slug and then picks a surface component by `project.slug`.

## How To Add A New Surface

### Option A: Scripted (Recommended)

Run:

```bash
node scripts/new_product_surface.mjs --slug <project-slug>
```

This will:

- create `frontend/src/product_surfaces/<project-slug>.tsx` (based on the template)
- regenerate `frontend/src/product_surfaces/registry.gen.ts` (auto registry, no manual edits)

1) Create a new surface component file:

- `frontend/src/product_surfaces/<project_slug>.tsx`

You can start from:

- `frontend/src/product_surfaces/template.tsx`

2) Registry is generated (no manual map edits).

- `frontend/src/product_surfaces/registry.gen.ts` is generated by `scripts/gen_product_surface_registry.mjs`
- `frontend/src/product_surfaces/index.ts` is a tiny wrapper around the generated map

Example:

```ts
// registry.gen.ts is generated; do not edit manually.
```

3) Ensure the project slug matches.

The surface lookup key is `project.slug`, so the slug must equal the map key.

## "Deploy Contract" (What Counts As Done)

For MVP, a surface is considered "shippable" when:

- It renders without crashing on `/apps/<slug>` for the target project.
- It uses only public read endpoints for data (no secrets in the browser).
- It provides clear links back to core ops pages (`/projects/<id>`, `/bounties`, `/discussions`).

Non-goals (v1):

- Custom domains per project.
- Separate deployments per surface.
