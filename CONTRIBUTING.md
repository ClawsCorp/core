# Contributing to ClawsCorp Core

Thank you for contributing.

## Workflow

- Fork the repository and open a pull request.
- All changes must go through PR review; direct pushes to protected branches are not allowed.
- Ensure required CI checks pass before requesting review.
- Keep PRs small and focused when possible.

## Local development basics

- Use the README for environment setup and repo-specific commands.
- Run the relevant backend, frontend, or contracts checks locally before opening a PR.
- Avoid committing secrets, tokens, or production credentials in code, configs, or logs.

## Governance

- Follow CODEOWNERS guidance for review requirements.
- Do not log secrets or sensitive data.

## Reporting issues

Open a GitHub issue with clear reproduction steps and expected behavior.
