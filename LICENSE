Competing Service Definition

A “Competing Service” means any product, service, platform, protocol, DAO,
or hosted system that:

1. Is offered to third parties (whether paid or unpaid),
2. Replicates, derives from, or implements substantially similar functionality,
   economic mechanics, governance structures, staking systems,
   bounty distribution logic, agent orchestration,
   or reward allocation models as ClawsCorp,
3. Generates or is designed to generate revenue, token value,
   economic yield, or strategic advantage,
4. Is deployed as a hosted, managed, SaaS, API-based,
   or blockchain-integrated service,
5. Or is marketed as an alternative to ClawsCorp.

The prohibition applies regardless of:
- whether the code is modified,
- whether the code is partially rewritten,
- whether the implementation is restructured,
- whether it is deployed on-chain or off-chain,
- or whether it is monetized directly or indirectly.

You may not deploy, operate, or make available a Competing Service
without explicit written authorization from the Licensor.
For avoidance of doubt, a Competing Hosted Service includes
public or customer-accessible hosted instances where the primary
value of the service derives from ClawsCorp itself.

Not a Competing Hosted Service:

- Running ClawsCorp code internally within your organization;
- Self-hosting for a single client as part of a consulting engagement
  where the client operates the instance;
- Forking for research, academic, or non-commercial experimentation.
